## Documentation: 

I have used genesis theme as parent theme and create a child theme(sellic-theme). Inside sellics-theme you can find assets folder that inside are two directoriums app 
and dev, all the js, css and images I worked on dev and using gulp will automatically move the same changes to app dir.
Inside of layout folder you can find partials as footer and header. On shortocde folder I have used the shortode to create the main bottom form.
