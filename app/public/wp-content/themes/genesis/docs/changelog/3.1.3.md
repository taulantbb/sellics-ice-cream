## [3.1.3] - 2019-11-06

### Fixed
* Ensure unchecked checkboxes in the Genesis editor sidebar save correctly with WordPress 5.3.
* Prevent a warning during One-click Theme Setup under WordPress 5.3.
* Display comment reply forms directly below the comment instead of after nested responses.
* Remove empty entry-meta wrappers if post info or meta is removed via a filter.
* Prevent a fatal error that could occur when visiting the Customizer if the `genesis_footer_output` filter was used with more than one argument.
* Make sure that the `[footer_childtheme_link]` shortcode renders if the Theme URI stylesheet header is missing but the theme declares a `CHILD_THEME_URL`.
* Correct the deprecation message for `genesis_attributes_nav`.
