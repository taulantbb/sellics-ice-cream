## [3.3.1] - 2020-03-25

Includes fixes for the Genesis language pack update feature.

### Fixed
* Internationalization: Deactivate Genesis Translations plugin on upgrade to Genesis 3.3.1. Ensures official Genesis translation language packs load correctly.
* Internationalization: Enable language pack updates work on WordPress multisite as long as the main site is using a Genesis theme. Previously, Genesis language pack update prompts would only appear if the main site used a Genesis theme and did not use the en_US locale.
* Internationalization: Fix a fatal error that could occur on sites with custom Genesis translation files that contain an unreadable PO-Revision-Date header.
