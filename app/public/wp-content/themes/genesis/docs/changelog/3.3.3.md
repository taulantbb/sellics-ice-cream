## [3.3.3] - 2020-08-10

### Added
* Accessibility: Added title as `aria-label` to `<article>` element to improve screen reader UX when using the rotor to view all articles on the page.

### Fixed
* Add missing `permission_callback` to public Genesis REST routes to prevent a notice under WordPress 5.5.

### Changed
* Use `excerpt_remove_blocks` to remove block content such as image captions and embed URLs from `get_the_content_limit`.
* Change "Enable auto-updates" in WordPress 5.5 to text that describes where to enable Genesis update checks.
* Improved standards for admin CSS.
* Disable `genesis-lazy-load-images` theme support under WordPress 5.5. WordPress 5.5 adds image lazy loading by default.

### Removed
* Use of `wp_make_content_images_responsive` in archive, singular, and featured widget images; `srcset` is applied via `wp_calculate_image_srcset` in `wp_get_attachment_image` used by `genesis_get_image`.
