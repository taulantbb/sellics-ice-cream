## [3.3.0] - 2020-02-26

### Added
* Internationalization: Non US English sites can now download the latest Genesis parent theme translations without using a plugin. 
    1. Check your language is listed and has translations at https://translate.studiopress.com/global/projects/genesis-framework/genesis/.
    2. Disable the Genesis Translations plugin if using.
    3. Check for language pack updates at Dashboard → Updates. If you do not see language pack updates, switch your site language to US English at Settings → General, save changes, then switch back to your own language and check for language updates again.

### Fixed
* Accessibility: Author box titles on author archives now use h2 instead of h4 to prevent heading levels from jumping.
* Accessibility: Prevent “Reader Interactions” screenreader text appearing below content if there are no comments, comment form, or trackbacks on display.
* Accessibility: Move `role="navigation"` from the list element to the wrapper element on pagination navigation.
* AMP: Fix CSS string format used in the AMP menu styles.
* Block Editor: Show singular, post-type, and ID-specific layouts in the Genesis sidebar layout selector.

### Changed
* REST: Accept multiple comma-separated layout types for the /layouts/ Genesis REST endpoint.
* Standards: switch all instances of `date()` to `gmdate()` to adhere to new WordPress standards recommendations.
* Tooling: simplified the creation of the Genesis zip file during the release process.

### Removed
* Internationalization: Old translations download script tooling was removed in favor of the new automated language pack download feature.
